== How to build k-nn ==

We will need the libirary in the path /home/lsds/forest/libi0/libi0/libi0, 
first create a soft link by: ln -s /home/lsds/forest/libi0/libi0/libi0
    $ make
    
== How to generate test data for k-nn ==

    $ python gen-input.py <testing data size> <training data size>
    The result will be save to knn-random-<testing data size>-<training data size>.input
    
== How to run k-nn on L0 ==

To run kmeans with input file knn-random-100-100000.input, i.e. a training set with 100000 samples and test set with 100 samples, 
you MUST first edit the knn.c (line 5-7) to sepcify the number of training samples, the number of testing samples and the number of classes. 
After editing knn.c, build k-nn.

    $ make
    $ am run -n 2 knn.bin knn-random-100-100000.input
